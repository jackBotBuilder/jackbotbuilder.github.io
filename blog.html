                        Hello World! Despite what that first sentence suggests, this isn't by any means the first update to this website. In fact, this inaugural
                         blog post should be in the 187th committ to the github repository that I'm using. However, it is the first of hopefully many posts! Over 
                        the past few days, I've been struggling over the CSS of this page. After about 8 hours of working on the finnicky code of this website, I 
                        get to bring you my first blog post!<br>
                        <br>
                        Please disregard that last sentence, it already seems to cheesy...<br>
                        <br>
                        Alright! Blogging time! Today, I slept in late because I stayed up until 11:30 last night working on CSS for this website. Yeaah, when I get
                        passionate about something, I really dive myself into it. I'm just glad it was a Friday night because, with the motivation I had, I 
                        probably would've stayed up just as late on a weeknight. Today, I woke up, exercised by running and doing strength training, then tried to 
                        charge my drone's batteries as fast as possible. My dad had agreed to take me flying today, but we had plans starting at 2:00. And, by the 
                        time that I was done exercising, it was already 10:30. I knew that, if I wanted to go flying, I would have to have my batteries charged by 
                        12:30. (And that's no easy feat) I ended up getting them all mostly charged in time to go flying at ~12:20. <br>
                        <br>
                        I want to start this paragraph off by saying, flying a drone ain't easy. You crash. Hard. Occasionally into some trees and pokey blackberry 
                        bushes.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ever since I started flying, I've been trying to improve as much as I can. I don't know why, but I love improving at anything. Part of the 
                        reason that I love speedcubing so much is that it exercises that love for improvement. Every time I do a solve, I can easily quantify how 
                        good it was because of how long it took me.<br> 
                        <br>
                        Sorry, I went on a bit of a tangent there. Back to flying. <br>
                        <br>
                        Lately, I've been getting a bit bored of just flying in circles around the same field. I can do a few flips and rolls, but those are a bit 
                        boring. I decided that I wanted to challenge myself by learning some new tricks. I decided that I want to learn to dive. When we got to the
                         field, I warmed up by flying close to the ground then I went a little higher on my second battery. After I did a few scary dives, I got a 
                        bit more comfortable with it. I accidentally went too high until I couldn't see how far over into the trees I was from the onboard camera.
                         I did the dive successfully, but when I pulled out of it I fell into the trees and chopped a lot of leaves. The camera wires also got shaken
                        up and I lost video to my FPV goggles. We all panicked because the drone had about $400 of parts inside it and we didn't know if it was still
                         stuck up in a high tree or if it was in the swath of blackberry vines underneath. Eventually, we were able to get a video transmission from 
                        the drone. All we saw was a crisp, clear picture of a blackberry, almost passive agressively confirming that we would need to trudge 
                        through the vines to find the lost drone. Eventually, the automatic beeper feature kicked in from the drone since it lost signal from the 
                        controller. We walked a short way through the vines, getting poked a lot on our way to eventually retrieving the drone.<br>
                        <br>
                        After quite the scare, we carefully flew around low on the ground to discharge the last battery before we packed up and left for the day.<br>
                        <br>
                        If you've made it to here, you are most likely extremely bored by my life. (and this was an interesting day for me!)<br>
                        <br>
                        Now, I'm sitting in my kitchen with my family as my dad prepares dinner and we talk and listen to music. That about sums up my day! I think 
                        that I'm missing the crucial skill of brevity when describing my day. I'll work on that in the future. :)<div>
                        <div>
                        Lastly, I thought that I should share a picture of this website's current CSS, as I'm sure it will change a lot over a short period of time.
