                        I know, I haven't blogged in a long time. I've been busy, getting used to school. I actually tried jiu jitsu yesterday, which is kind of a 
                        significant step for someone like me with an aversion to physical contact. For some reason, I really liked it and I think that I might make 
                        it a regular thing. It was wierd, I think there's a limit to how out-of-my-comfort-zone I can get. It's still pretty uncomfortable, but ya 
                        know it can't get much wierder than having to practice moves where you grab a sweaty person's uniform and put your foot up on their hip to 
                        swing them down and kick their leg out to get on top of them. It looks like magic when you watch the instructors do it, but then you see me 
                        doing it and it's not so cool anymore... Overall, it was a positive to my day because everyone there was really awesome.<br><br>
                        
                        HOLY CRAP. I JUST FOUND THE COOLEST THING ON SPOTIFY. RIGHT HERE. RIGHT NOW. AS I'M WRITING THIS... I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS PERSON DID THIS, 
                        BUT APPARENTLY YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE A SPECIFIC SONG'S DURATION BAR WHEN YOU RELEASE IT.<br><br>
                        
                        That explanation probably wasn't sufficient. I'll do a better job now. I'm listening to a lofi playlist right now as I'm writing and one of 
                        the songs was a lofi version of the cantina band song from Star Wars. You know that little bar that tells you how far you are through the 
                        song and that you can use to go to other places in the song? SOMEHOW, THEY MADE IT LOOK LIKE AN EXTENDING LIGHTSABER. I've never seen this 
                        before and I didn't know that artists could customize that. (I know, the things that I get excited about are very pathetic)<br><br>
                       
                        
                        (mmhm, clearing my throat back to my normal calm, collected, deep voice after that slight detour)<br><br>
                        
                        Today, I really just went through my normal routine. I hit a little bit of everything, starting to learn "I Guess That's Why They Call It 
                        The Blues" by Elton John on the piano. I'm just burning my way through a book of his most popular songs. I worked on an AP Physics lab for 
                        awhile where I had to calculate the speed and acceleration throughout different trials of a moving cart. I was tasked with, in different 
                        cases, calculating either average or instantaneous speed.<br><br>
                        
                        Note: I have recieved some comments from impatient viewers of this blog about the Special Suprise Toggle button that has appeared on the 
                        website. This is a new feature that is not yet into affect, as the JS is still being implemented and debugged. I'm hoping to have this 
                        operational by October.<br><br>
                        
                        Also, I uploaded a picture of my great discovery to the repository so that I can show it here. Below (should) be a picture of the lightsaber 
                        music bar.

                        Today was labor day! It really wasn't that significant for my family. My sister has been visiting her friend in another state since Thursday.
                        My mom went and picked her up at about 1:00 in the morning because we're extremely cheap and will gladly do flights in the middle of the 
                        night if it means that we save $100 on tickets. We're definitely not poor, but we're very frugal. I then exercised, worked on precalc for 
                        awhile, then we went on a hike with some friends down the street. I then decided that I was tired of working and played some Super Mario 
                        Odyssey for about 45 minutes until we went to a Labor Day Potluck in a cul de sac around the street. It was one of those situations where 
                        you see these people for a couple of hours, make some friends, then forget their names a week later and occasionally make small talk when 
                        they pass by your house on a walk. By the time the next Labor Day Potluck rolls around, you're ready to do it all again!<br><br>
                        
                        Recently, there's been another major CSS Update to this blog specifically. I created a separate file in the github directory called 
                        blogCss.css that makes blog posts look like they are in the IDLE Shell. I was able to use google to get the exact hex colors used for the 
                        background, strings, and comments. (the text is naturally just white).

                        Today was interesting...<br><br>
                        
                        I spent the entire day with my parents fixing my room back up after a lithium polymer drone battery caught on fire as I was charging it. I 
                        didn't see the fire start, but I've seen videos before. The battery baloons up before it pops in a single spot and starts spewing fire and 
                        smoke. We heard a sound of pressure releasing and then all of the smoke detectors went off. We're extremely lucky that it happened how it 
                        did because it only scorched the wood top of my desk and caught itself, another battery, and the arm of my desk chair on fire. A majority of 
                        the damage was done not by the fire itself but by the fire extinguisher. My entire desk including my computer and all of my desk toys was 
                        covered in smelly white dust. We then proceeded to pull my desk away from the wall and clean every single object of the hundreds on my desk. 
                        My mom goes a bit crazy when it comes to cleaning. She organized and dusted all of my shelves on a half of my room. My desk is now pristine 
                        with the 3d printer and my computer on one half of my L shaped desk and room for engineering/math on the other half. <br><br> 
                        
                        I'm still not fully back to normal after walking into my room with my desk in smoky flames. I also feel wierd in my room because I know that 
                        there are small cracks that have the shiny, stinky dust in them. I can also feel the dust residue on my desk, keyboard, and several other 
                        objects that I have to touch a lot.<br><br>
                        
                        I've now learned to be terrified of those lithium polymer batteries. We're going to try to make a fireproof charging box out of an ammo can.

                        I had my first AP Physics class today! I was able to re-learn trig for probably the fourth time now, as I just haven't used it much until 
                        now. I think it'll stick this time. I moved my precalc class from the end of September up to Friday so that I get to do double the math for 
                        the week as I scramble to finish Algebra 2 and my summer physics class before I get to school year classes. Yeah... I didn't really have 
                        much of a summer break. I spent a month of it in a writing class at UW that seemed to drag on forever. I then spent about a week doing 
                        lots of engineering with my cousin up until just a few hours before our flight left to a 4 day long trip to the east coast to visit family.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        For some reason, it feels like every trip I have to take to see family takes the price of some sort of exhausting drama bubbling up.
                        <br><br>
                        I got back from that trip several weeks ago and have been wrapping up all of my tiring summer classes to get to even more school year 
                        classes. Yup, I've got APCS, AP Physics, Precalc, HS Contest Math, Piano, HS English, Spanish, and a slew of other things my mom wants me to 
                        do such as weekly volunteering at the local food bank or geography.<br><br> 
                        
                        Also, I did rank that list in order of most excited to least. I don't like my writing or foreign language.

                        I'M FINALLY REGISTERED FOR A SPEEDCUBING COMPETITION!!!<br><br>
                        
                        Yes, If you go to the WCA website and really dig through the competitions, you'll find a competition whose registration ended today and has a
                         Jack ****** B***** registered for 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and possibly 5x5. I haven't learned any of the parity algorithms for 5x5, so I'm not sure 
                        if I will do 5x5. Luckily I have until Sept 17th to update my events if I learn parity. Right now, I'm focusing on 3x3, 4x4, and 3x3 blind. 
                        I will probably stop practicing 3x3 blind until this competition ends because It isn't hosted and I should focus on events that I'm actually 
                        competing in. I will definitely sign up for 3x3 blind when I try to get on the 24hr competition registration. If you read yesterday's post, 
                        I still need to give my thoughts on the MGC Square-1 and the QiYi MS Pyraminx.<br><br>
                        
                        YJ MGC Square-1 (Fully Magnetic):
                        This puzzle still confuses me. I've gotten a feel for how the pieces move, but I still need a lot more experience with it before I'm 
                        confident with how it moves. I can, after a lot of struggle, usually get it into cube shape. I always get stuck on the case where I have one 
                        square shaped side and one side that is almost square shaped but has a flipped corner and edge. The confusion of this puzzle aside, I think 
                        that it's pretty good. It sometimes catches on itself when I do backwards slash moves, but It's not common. It has good corner cutting for a 
                        shapeshifting cube and it felt great out of the box.
                        
                        QiYi MS Pyraminx:
                        I have very inconsistent times on pyraminx. Sometimes I get mid 20s solves and sometimes I'm 2+ minutes in and still trying to move edges 
                        around right. My only problem with this pyraminx is that, since they spin freely, the corners can easily spin around during your solve and 
                        get a +2 or DNF. The magnets aren't strong enough on the edges to firmly hold the corners in place while you do the rest of your solve. 
                        Other than that, I think that the puzzle is too fast for my currently slow solves. Hopefully, as I get better I can adapt to the speed.

                        Today I had my first High School Contest Math class back from summer. Technically it was my first HIGH SCHOOL Contest Math class ever 
                        because I did Middle School for the last two years. I enjoyed it much more than the Middle School section because the problems were too easy 
                        and the kids were immature. In the High School section I am challenged by the problems and the kids are much more mature. I said yesterday 
                        that I would give my thoughts on the cubes I got, so I'll do that now. Keep in mind that I've never touched a single other one of these 
                        puzzles, so I have no baseline to compare with.<br><br>
                        
                        YJ MGC Magnetic 2x2:<br><br>
                        It felt very dry and scratchy out of the box, so it took some lubricant to make it feel much better. Sadly, in the process, I somehow got 
                        lubricant on the outside of the cube, so it is very oily. I loosened the screws a lot, so it can corner cut about half of a piece off. 
                        Overall, I think it's pretty good and I would reccomend it to a beginner. <br><br>
                        
                        MoYu Weilong Skewb Magnetic- Maglev:<br><br>
                        Just like the MGC 2x2, this skewb felt dry out of the box. However, it wasn't as bad as the 2x2, so I just got used to it with a little bit 
                        of lubricant. I just learned skewb yesterday and I've done probably 20 solves with it. I'm averaging around 30 seconds right now and I feel 
                        like I should be doing better. Skewb requires so few moves compared to 3x3 that I should be averaging below my 3x3 average, but I average 25 
                        seconds on 3x3. But, that isn't a comment about this specific puzzle; it's just my thoughts on skewb in general. I have messed around with 
                        the maglev on this cube a little bit and it does feel very fun to turn.<br><br>
                        
                        I'm getting tired, so I'm going to talk about the rest of the cubes tomorrow.

                        I didn't get a chance to post today because we stayed until 11:00 at the neighbor's house playing board games. I know what you're thinking. 
                        <br>
                        "Hmm, it's 11:10 right now for you, so why didn't you blog last night?"
                        <br>
                        Yes, I know, but by the time I brushed my teeth, it was 11:15 and I proceeded to nearly die solving my new square-1 that I got yesterday 
                        until midnight. Oh yes, the new cubes came yesterday. I'm too tired right now, but I'll talk about each of them in tomorrow's post.<br><br>
                        
                        I haven't mentioned it before, but I like speedrunning video games. It's a recent thing, but I've done 2 Super Mario Odyssey speedruns and 
                        started learning Breath of The Wild Any%. I like speedrunning Super Mario Odyssey, but Any% is too long of a category to run. I know that it
                         gets shorter as I continue, but I still can't dedicate 2 hour installments to speedruning this. I decided that meme categories would be a 
                        good idea. Meme categories are much shorter but still require skill and a variety of glitches. I'm thinking about trying either soup% or 
                        nipple%. In soup%, the goal is to reach wooded kingdom and take a warp painting to luncheon kindom where you can die in the soup as fast as 
                        possible. In nipple%, the goal is to reach wooded kingdom and purchase the boxer shorts outfit for mario as fast as possible. Although it is 
                        immature, it is still a contender for the highest (enjoyment)/(time spent) ratio. A lot of faster speedruns are done in two player mode 
                        because it allows for more movement options. But, since most speedrunners are just sitting alone in their moms' basements without any real 
                        friends, they don't have anyone else to do the speedrun with. (plus, the second player is a bit boring to play in speedruns) So, I opted 
                        with what most people do.<br><br>
                        
                        Achievement Unlocked:<br>
                        Hands And Feet<br><br>
                        
                        Yes, I tried playing with my hands and feet. Since I'm not used to bending my toes around the controller to hit inputs right, I got sore 
                        fast. But, I think this will add another challenge for me. :)

                        The most interesting thing I did today was going to Costco. I just did my schoolwork, taking a break at lunch to help my sister with her 
                        coding project. It reminded me how much I love coding and how much I can't wait for APCS to start. <br><br>
                        
                        I got updated today that my cubes will come on Saturday instead of Monday. Tomorrow I've got my first spanish class after the summer. It's 
                        tough because the teachers are always changing schedules and you can't get a single teacher for very long. Since I always have a substitute 
                        teacher that I've never met before, I get extremely nervous getting onto a video call with someone I don't know.<br><br>
                        
                        I feel like that's a bad end to a blog post, so I'll try to find something else.<br><br>
                        
                        (10 mins of thinking go by)<br><br>
                        
                        Yesterday I helped my sister destroy the CSS of a blog that she had administrative editing powers on. We turned the entire blog into rick 
                        astley themed CSS. The blog's creator and manager got really mad because they had no way to know which of the admins changed the CSS. They 
                        had a backup copy of the CSS somewhere, so it all got fixed. But, it was still an awesome moment.

                        Today was my second day of high school! I'm anxious to start AP CS because English isn't my cup of tea. Today I started creating a character
                        for a short story and their foil. Yeah, not the most exciting. But, another competition was scheduled near me at the end of december!<br><br>
                        
                  
                        It's only for NXN Cubes, so it won't be the most exciting competition. However, it'll be a great first competition for me. I also bought some
                        more cubes from speedcubeshop so that I'll have more events to register for in the 24HR competition. I bought a 2x2, Pyraminx, Skewb, 
                        a Square-1, and a cube bag so that I can take cubes places without them getting scratched in my backpack. They should arrive next Monday or
                        Tuesday, so I can give my thoughts to the 0 people reading this. Also, I will get increasingly more bubbly as the days go by and I get more 
                        shipping updates.

                        I was really busy yesterday, so I couldn't write. I was able to charge my batteries and go flying again in the middle of the day.<br><br>
                        
                        Today was the first day of the school year for me. (I'm in high school!) My parents were fighting, so my mom was really stressed all day
                         while she also asked me a lot of questions about what I was doing. I felt like, if I did anything wrong, it might tip her off and I would 
                        get yelled at.<br><br>
                        
                        Today, I started AP Computer Science and I think it's going to be really fun! It starts in a couple weeks, so I'm just left with English, 
                        Algebra 2, and AP Physics. I start AP Physics on Wednesday with my first live class. <br><br>
                        
                        I didn't talk about this in the last post, but I've been looking for a speedcubing competition near me for at least 6 months. I couldn't go 
                        to any of the competitions near me because I could never get registered. The last competition's registration both started and ended while 
                        I was on a plane back from vacation. However, there's now a competition scheduled for feburary 2023 with 24 hours of straight cubing. :D 
                        They're hosting every single WCA event except for FMC. I've been wanting to learn blindfolded 3x3 solving for a long time, and signing up 
                        for it will give me motivation to practice. I know it sounds really nerdy, but it sounds really fun to go to a 24 hour long competition.<br>

                        Hello World! Despite what that first sentence suggests, this isn't by any means the first update to this website. In fact, this inaugural
                         blog post should be in the 187th committ to the github repository that I'm using. However, it is the first of hopefully many posts! Over 
                        the past few days, I've been struggling over the CSS of this page. After about 8 hours of working on the finnicky code of this website, I 
                        get to bring you my first blog post!<br>
                        <br>
                        Please disregard that last sentence, it already seems to cheesy...<br>
                        <br>
                        Alright! Blogging time! Today, I slept in late because I stayed up until 11:30 last night working on CSS for this website. Yeaah, when I get
                        passionate about something, I really dive myself into it. I'm just glad it was a Friday night because, with the motivation I had, I 
                        probably would've stayed up just as late on a weeknight. Today, I woke up, exercised by running and doing strength training, then tried to 
                        charge my drone's batteries as fast as possible. My dad had agreed to take me flying today, but we had plans starting at 2:00. And, by the 
                        time that I was done exercising, it was already 10:30. I knew that, if I wanted to go flying, I would have to have my batteries charged by 
                        12:30. (And that's no easy feat) I ended up getting them all mostly charged in time to go flying at ~12:20. <br>
                        <br>
                        I want to start this paragraph off by saying, flying a drone ain't easy. You crash. Hard. Occasionally into some trees and pokey blackberry 
                        bushes.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ever since I started flying, I've been trying to improve as much as I can. I don't know why, but I love improving at anything. Part of the 
                        reason that I love speedcubing so much is that it exercises that love for improvement. Every time I do a solve, I can easily quantify how 
                        good it was because of how long it took me.<br> 
                        <br>
                        Sorry, I went on a bit of a tangent there. Back to flying. <br>
                        <br>
                        Lately, I've been getting a bit bored of just flying in circles around the same field. I can do a few flips and rolls, but those are a bit 
                        boring. I decided that I wanted to challenge myself by learning some new tricks. I decided that I want to learn to dive. When we got to the
                         field, I warmed up by flying close to the ground then I went a little higher on my second battery. After I did a few scary dives, I got a 
                        bit more comfortable with it. I accidentally went too high until I couldn't see how far over into the trees I was from the onboard camera.
                         I did the dive successfully, but when I pulled out of it I fell into the trees and chopped a lot of leaves. The camera wires also got shaken
                        up and I lost video to my FPV goggles. We all panicked because the drone had about $400 of parts inside it and we didn't know if it was still
                         stuck up in a high tree or if it was in the swath of blackberry vines underneath. Eventually, we were able to get a video transmission from 
                        the drone. All we saw was a crisp, clear picture of a blackberry, almost passive agressively confirming that we would need to trudge 
                        through the vines to find the lost drone. Eventually, the automatic beeper feature kicked in from the drone since it lost signal from the 
                        controller. We walked a short way through the vines, getting poked a lot on our way to eventually retrieving the drone.<br>
                        <br>
                        After quite the scare, we carefully flew around low on the ground to discharge the last battery before we packed up and left for the day.<br>
                        <br>
                        If you've made it to here, you are most likely extremely bored by my life. (and this was an interesting day for me!)<br>
                        <br>
                        Now, I'm sitting in my kitchen with my family as my dad prepares dinner and we talk and listen to music. That about sums up my day! I think 
                        that I'm missing the crucial skill of brevity when describing my day. I'll work on that in the future. :)<div>
                       <div>
                        Lastly, I thought that I should share a picture of this website's current CSS, as I'm sure it will change a lot over a short period of time.
